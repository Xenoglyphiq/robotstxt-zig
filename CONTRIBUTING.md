# Contributing to robots.txt for Zig

Thanks for helping. This package is one of several language ports of the same spec, and all of them must behave identically.

## How this repo works

- The package itself lives at the repo root, laid out the way Zig expects: `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon`, the core module `src/robotstxt.zig` and the io module `src/io.zig`. The conformance runner is `tools/conformance.zig`; the benchmark is `tools/bench.zig`.
- **`.spec/`** is a copy of the spec and its conformance cases from **`Xenoglyphiq/robotstxt-spec`**, at the version in `.spec/SPEC_VERSION`. Don't edit it here; it's replaced when the port moves to a newer spec.
- **`.kit/`** holds shared conventions, schemas and the validator. Don't edit it here either.

Read `.kit/CONVENTIONS.md` and `.spec/spec/SPEC.md` before changing behavior.

## Where to send a change

| You want to… | Where |
|---|---|
| Fix a bug in this port | Here. Add a test or point to the conformance case it fixes |
| Change how the library behaves | The spec repo `Xenoglyphiq/robotstxt-spec`. Open an issue there first |
| Report that this port behaves differently from another | The spec repo, with the input; it becomes a conformance case |
| Improve docs or examples for this port | Here |

## Checks every PR must pass

1. `python .kit/validate.py .spec` (needs `pip install pyyaml jsonschema`)
2. Build and unit tests: `zig build test`, plus `zig fmt --check build.zig build.zig.zon src tools examples`
3. Conformance runner: `zig build conformance`; every claimed level must pass
4. The three canonical examples: `zig build examples`

## Style

- Follow Zig's own conventions for names, errors and packaging.
- The core module does no I/O; fetching and transports belong in `src/io.zig`.
- Errors keep the kinds and codes from the spec; tests assert kind and code, never message text.
- Every public item has a doc comment naming the spec operation it implements.
